                <div class="history-text about-text">
                    <p>Stockholm, capital and largest city of Sweden. Stockholm is located at the junction of Lake Mälar
                        (Mälaren) and Salt Bay
                        (Saltsjön), an arm of the Baltic Sea, opposite the Gulf of Finland. The city is built upon
                        numerous islands as well as
                        the mainland of Uppland and Södermanland. By virtue of its location, Stockholm is regarded as
                        one of the most beautiful
                        capital cities in the world.</p>
                    <p>Stockholm was first mentioned as a town in 1252 and was largely built by the Swedish ruler Birger
                        Jarl. It grew rapidly
                        as a result of a trade agreement made with the German city of Lübeck. This agreement ensured
                        Lübeck merchants freedom
                        from customs charges for their trade in Sweden, as well as the right to settle there. The city
                        came to be officially
                        regarded as the Swedish capital in 1436. After conflicts between the Danes and Swedes for many
                        years, Stockholm was
                        liberated from Danish rule by Gustav I Vasa in 1523.</p>

                    <p>Stockholm developed rapidly in the mid-17th century as Sweden temporarily became a great power.
                        The
                        central government
                        departments were then placed there, and the city became an independent administrative unit. The
                        old
                        city walls were torn
                        down, and new districts grew up north and south of the “city between the bridges.” In the 18th
                        century, fires destroyed
                        large parts of the city, and stone buildings were constructed to replace the old wooden houses.
                        Stockholm had by then
                        become the cultural centre of Sweden; many of its literary societies and scientific academies
                        date
                        from this time.</p>
                    <p>A new period of development began with industrialization in the 19th century, and the
                        introduction of
                        municipally
                        organized cleaning (1859) and sanitation (1861) contributed to a rapid increase in population.
                        During this time
                        redevelopment took place in the medieval city nucleus, buildings were reconstructed, boulevards,
                        avenues, and parks were
                        laid out, and many of the city’s present-day schools, museums, libraries, and hospitals were
                        built.
                        Many suburbs and
                        satellite towns have subsequently developed.</p>

                    <p>The original nucleus of the city is the “city between the bridges”—Gamla Stan (Old Town),
                        consisting of Stads Island,
                        Helgeands Island, and Riddar Island. The buildings in this area are mainly from the 16th and
                        17th centuries. This
                        well-preserved city nucleus, with the original network of streets and many of its buildings
                        dating from the Middle Ages,
                        is legally protected from change. Stads Island contains the Royal Palace; Storkyrkan, also
                        called the Cathedral, or
                        Church, of St. Nicolas; the German Church; the House of Lords; the government offices; the Stock
                        Exchange; and a number
                        of other notable buildings. Riddar Island is dominated by the Riddarholm Church. The House of
                        Parliament and the
                        National Bank are on Helgeands Island.</p>
                    <p>Stockholm is Sweden’s leading industrial area. Its major industries include metal and machine
                        manufacturing, paper and
                        printing, foodstuffs, and chemicals. It is also the country’s chief wholesale and retail centre
                        and serves as the
                        headquarters of many banks and insurance companies. Stockholm is also the second largest port in
                        Sweden (Göteborg being
                        the first). The national government’s many offices are a major employer in the city, as are
                        various educational,
                        scientific, and cultural institutions.</p>

                        a third of the country's GDP, and is among the top 10 regions in Europe by GDP per
                        capita. Ranked as an alpha-
                        global city, it is the largest in Scandinavia and the main centre for corporate headquarters
                        in the Nordic
                        region. The city is home to some of Europe's top ranking universities, such as the Stockholm
                        School of Economics,
                        Karolinska Institute and KTH Royal Institute of Technology. It hosts the annual Nobel
                        Prize ceremonies and
                        banquet at the Stockholm Concert Hall and Stockholm City Hall. One of the city's most prized
                        museums, the Vasa Museum,
                        is the most visited non-art museum in Scandinavia. The Stockholm metro, opened in 1950,
                        is well known for the
                        decor of its stations; it has been called the longest art gallery in the world.
                        Sweden's national football
                        arena is located north of the city centre, in Solna. Ericsson Globe, the national indoor arena,
                        is in the southern part
                        of the city. The city was the host of the 1912 Summer Olympics, and hosted the equestrian
                        portion of the 1956 Summer
                        Olympics otherwise held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.</p>

                    <p>The city-owned company Stokab started in 1994 to build a fiber-optic network throughout the
                        municipality as a level
                        playing field for all operators (City of Stockholm, 2011). Around a decade later, the network
                        was 1.2 million kilometres
                        (0.7 million miles) long making it the longest optic fiber network in the world and now has over
                        90 operators and 450
                        enterprises as customers. 2011 was the final year of a three-year project which brought fiber to
                        100% of public housing,
                        meaning an extra 95,000 houses were added. (City of Stockholm, 2011)</p>

                        Apart from being Sweden's capital, Stockholm houses many national cultural institutions. The
                        Stockholm region is home to three of Sweden's World Heritage Sites – spots judged as
                        invaluable places that belong to all of humanity: The Drottningholm Palace, Skogskyrkogården
                        (The Woodland Cemetery) and Birka. In 1998, Stockholm was named European Capital
                        of Culture.</p>

                    <p>Stockholm's architecture (along with Visby, Gotland) provided the inspiration for Japanese
                        anime director Hayao
                        Miyazaki as he sought to evoke an idealized city untouched by World War. His creation called
                        Koriko, draws directly from
                        what Miyazaki felt was Stockholm's sense of well-established architectural unity, vibrancy,
                        independence, and
                        safety.</p>
                    <p>Stockholm is the media centre of Sweden. It has four nationwide daily newspapers and is also the
                        central location of the
                        publicly funded radio (SR) and television (SVT). In addition, all other major television
                        channels have their base in
                        Stockholm, such as: TV3, TV4 and TV6. All major magazines are also located to Stockholm, as are
                        the largest literature
                        publisher, the Bonnier group. The world's best-selling video game Minecraft was created in
                        Stockholm by Markus 'Notch'
                        Persson in 2009, and its company Mojang is headquartered there.</p>
