                        dynamic city centre.
                        Spread across 14 islands on Lake Mälaren, Stockholm’s very environment encourages you to rove
                        and see where you’ll end
                        up. There are around 50 bridges in the centre alone, while ferries are a fun way to get about.

                        that, what is Swedish cuisine? Ask most locals, and they’ll respond saying that a typical dish
                        at one of the best
                        restaurants in the city is one that starts off simple.</p>

                        <p>Dating from the 1200s and crammed with must-see sights, attractions, cafés, authentic
                            restaurants, and boutique shops,
                            the area of Gamla Stan (Old Town) is a living-breathing museum in its own right. For
                            many,
                            this is the first stop on
                            their journey of exploration. Certainly there's no better way to instantly absorb the
                            feel
                            of Stockholm and get to grips
                            with the city's culture. Plenty of souvenirs and gifts are available in the Old Town,
                            and
                            you will find yourself
                            transported back to medieval times as you meander through a bewildering labyrinth of
                            tiny,
                            winding streets. Mysterious
                            vaults and ancient frescoes lurk behind picturesque facades.</p>

                        <p>The incredible Vasa battleship was intended to be the pride of the Swedish Imperial fleet,
                            yet in a forerunner of the
                            Titanic disaster centuries later, sank on its maiden voyage in 1628. An amazing salvage
                            operation took place in 1961,
                            and now you can marvel at this glorious time capsule, 95 percent of which is entirely
                            original. The three masts on the
                            roof of the museum are not just a tourist draw; they were reconstructed to the exact height
                            and specifications of the
                            original masts. This is the most visited museum in Sweden, and rightfully so. More than one
                            million people a year come
                            here to enjoy the different exhibitions and watch the movie on the ship's history. Entry is
                            free if you are under 18
                            years of age.</p>

                        <p>A tranquil oasis in the heart of the city, the island of Djurgården draws tourists and locals
                            alike, particularly during
                            the summer months of long lazy days and short nights. The park forms part of the Royal
                            National City Park, and it's a
                            perfect place for a stroll and picnic as well as being home to several of Stockholm's top
                            museums and other attractions.
                            Scattered about are pleasant cafés, restaurants, snack-bars, and hotels. You can hire
                            bicycles to explore the forest
                            trails or, if you're feeling adventurous, take to the waterways in a canoe. The popular Vasa
                            Museum and Abba the Museum
                            are located here, as is the open-air museum Skansen and Gröna Lund amusement park. A fun way
                            to arrive is by ferry from
                            Gamla Stan or Slussen (both on the T-Bana). Alternatively, jump on a tram from
                            Norrmalmstorg, take the bus, or stroll
                            from the city center (15 minutes). Drop by the Djurgården visitor center for more

                            particularly those with young children. Not only will you be treated to an authentic taste
                            of Sweden as it once was, but
                            also the wonderful Skansen Aquarium and the Children's Zoo. More than 150 different
                            buildings and houses were collected
                            from all around the country and reassembled here. On display are distinct town districts,
                            including manor houses, a
                            bakery, the beautiful Seglora timber church, and a pottery, all brought to life by costumed
                            staff. At the zoo are moose,
                            bears, lynxes, wolves, and seals. You can visit the aquarium for an extra fee and see more
                            than 200 different animals
                            from around the world, including many species of monkeys. For traditional Swedish

                            official residence of the King of Sweden. Interestingly, the Queen's residence lies
                            elsewhere, on the beautiful island
                            and UNESCO World Heritage Site Drottningholm (Queen's island), about a 45-minute ferry ride
                            from Stockholm and an easy
                            day trip. A rich taste of the once mighty Swedish Empire, the palace is one of the largest
                            in Europe boasting in excess
                            of 600 rooms and several museums. Dating from the 18th century and Baroque in style, the
                            palace houses many gems. Here,
                            you can see Queen Kristina's silver throne and visit the Museum of Antiquities, the Armoury,
                            the Tre Kronor (Three

                            and stars in countless images and postcards of the city. Dating from 1923, the hall opened

                            Midsummer's Eve. Housed within are assembly rooms, offices, works of art, and the machinery

                            prestigious annual Nobel Banquets are held here. Recipients dine first in Blå hallen (The

                            boats of all shapes and sizes. Many city-dwellers own summer houses on the islands of the

                            Bearing all this in mind, to experience Stockholm from the water is surely a must-do for any

                            Museum of Science and Technology. The reactor is now a popular venue for modern art and
                            dance performances.

                        <p>The telescope was made in 2007 by the German company Astro Optik and weighs a baffling 2.3
                            metric tonnes, nearly 5,100
                            pounds. Originally it was used for environmental physics studies and was later taken over by
                            the astronomy department.
                            It is now used as a testbed for new astronomical instruments, as a tool for teaching
                            students, and for the observation
                            of supernovas.

                        <p>No trip to Stockholm between May and September is complete without a visit to the city’s
                            outdoor party spaces. Rooftop
                            bars Slakthuset, in a former slaughterhouse, and Tak, on a revamped square in brutalist
                            Norrmalm, are the most
                            talked-about locations right now. But the epicentre of summer nightlife on Södermalm is
                            Trädgården, a massive courtyard
                            dance area with burger shacks, table tennis and a jigsaw of bars bedecked with fairy lights.

                        <p>For most people, Stockholm doesn’t immediately conjure up images of tanning on an idyllic
                            beach followed by an afternoon
                            dip. But you can, in fact, do both, right in the city centre. Just a 15-minute stroll from
                            urban Hornstull’s bustling
                            coffee shops and bars is Långholmen island, one of the Swedish capital’s most frequented
                            swimming spots. With a modest
                            sandy front, it’s surrounded by flat rocks and a grassy bank where locals love to picnic.

                            all. While it sometimes seems there is an H&M every few steps don’t miss out on the other
                            gems along the way. Åhlens
                            City, right at the corner of Drottninggatan and Klarabergsgatan, is one of the best
                            department stores in the city, with
                            not just an excellent selection of fashion but also books, homewares, makeup, and much, much
                            more. The street is also
                            home to plenty of tourist shops, as well as some great restaurants and cafés.

                            Olympic-medals in their cabinet, both Sweden’s women's –and men’s national team is a force

                            the ice. And SHL (Swedish Hockey League, the top-tier league in hockey) is consistently
                            ranked as one of the greatest in
                            the world. The most prominent clubs in Stockholm are Djurgården and AIK.
